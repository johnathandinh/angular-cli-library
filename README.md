# Angular Cli with Library

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.7.

This is an edited version of a new app generated with ng new. It is a result of workarounds in order to make it possible for angular-cli to work with a shared library.

It currently supports AOT, SCSS, lazy loading and everything you could do with a normal app generated with ng new. 

Commands have been added to make you life easier.

## Development server

Run `npm run app1` to serve app1. Run `npm run app2` to serve app2 etc. Names can change if you want (package.json). You can have multiple apps running in your browser as each app is launched on a different port. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` or `http://localhost:4201/` for example. Each app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run app1:build` to build app1. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/app1` directory. All builds have by default --prod.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Running unit tests
